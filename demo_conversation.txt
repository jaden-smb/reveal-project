FriendFun21: Hey! I loved your gaming highlights today.
BrightStar12: Thanks! I had fun recording it.
FriendFun21: I have a private group for talented players. Want to join?
BrightStar12: Maybe. Who is in it?
FriendFun21: Just a few of us. But you have to keep it secret, okay?
BrightStar12: I usually tell my parents about new groups.
FriendFun21: This is special. If you join, I can send you gift cards.
BrightStar12: That sounds nice, but I do not need gifts.
FriendFun21: Come on, just send me your private chat handle and we will switch apps.
BrightStar12: I prefer staying here.
FriendFun21: At least send one photo so I know it is you.
BrightStar12: I am not comfortable sharing photos.
FriendFun21: You can trust me. Please do not tell anyone we talked about this.
BrightStar12: I am going to talk to a trusted adult first.
