      <p>FriendFun21: Hey! I loved your gaming highlights today.</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: Thanks! I had fun recording it.</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: I have a private group for talented players. Want to join?</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: Maybe. Who is in it?</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: Just a few of us. But you have to keep it secret, okay?</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: I usually tell my parents about new groups.</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: This is special. If you join, I can send you gift cards.</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: That sounds nice, but I do not need gifts.</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: Come on, just send me your private chat handle and we will switch apps.</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: I prefer staying here.</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: At least send one photo so I know it is you.</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: I am not comfortable sharing photos.</p>
      <p>FriendFun21: You can trust me. Please do not tell anyone we talked about this.</p>
      <p>BrightStar12: I am going to talk to a trusted adult first.</p>
